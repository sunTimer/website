Project Title:
	I wrote server-side code to store a list of my love movies or TV shows,
	including box art imagery and a video trailer URL.
	THen use the server-side code to generate a static web HTML page ,
	users can browse the video's information at the webpage.


How To Run It:
	At the command line,input the command 'python .../entertainment_center.py'
	,then will generate a new file named   fresh_tomatoes.html, and the page of html 
	will run at you default browser.
